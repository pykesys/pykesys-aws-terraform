âœ… Memory-Based Scaling Addition:
Alarm for mem_used_percent > 90%

Uses CloudWatch Agent custom metric from namespace MyApp

Triggers scale-out and SNS alert

ðŸ§  Make sure the CloudWatch Agent is properly configured (via the cwagent-config.json) to emit memory metrics under the MyApp namespace â€” which is already included in this package.
