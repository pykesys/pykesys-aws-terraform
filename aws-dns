To configure AWS to route your custom domain name (e.g., `example.com`) to your resources (like EC2 instances, Load Balancers, S3 buckets, etc.), you will need to use **Amazon Route 53**, which is AWS's managed Domain Name System (DNS) service. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

### Steps to Route Your Domain Name in AWS

#### 1. **Create a Hosted Zone in Route 53**
   A **Hosted Zone** in Route 53 is a container for your domain's DNS records.

   - Go to the [AWS Route 53 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53).
   - On the left sidebar, select **Hosted zones** and click the **Create hosted zone** button.
   - Enter your **domain name** (e.g., `example.com`).
   - For **Type**, choose **Public Hosted Zone** (if you want your domain to be publicly accessible on the internet).
   - Click **Create hosted zone**.

   Once the hosted zone is created, AWS will automatically create some default **NS (Name Server)** and **SOA (Start of Authority)** records for your domain.

#### 2. **Update Domain Registrar's Name Servers**
   After creating the hosted zone, you need to update your domain registrar (where you purchased your domain, e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.) with the name servers that AWS provides.

   - In the Route 53 hosted zone, note the **NS records** (Name Servers) provided by AWS. These will look something like this:
     ```
     ns-123.awsdns-45.net
     ns-234.awsdns-56.com
     ns-345.awsdns-67.org
     ns-456.awsdns-78.co.uk
     ```
   - Go to your **domain registrar** and update the **Name Servers** with the values you got from Route 53.
     - This step is important because it tells the internet to use Route 53 to resolve your domain.

   **Note**: It may take up to **48 hours** for DNS changes to propagate globally, but it’s usually faster.

#### 3. **Add DNS Records to Route 53**
   Once the domain's name servers are pointing to AWS Route 53, you can add DNS records to route traffic to your resources (e.g., EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancers, etc.).

   Some common DNS records include:

   - **A Record**: Maps your domain to an IP address.
   - **CNAME Record**: Maps your subdomain to another domain name (used for aliasing).
   - **MX Record**: Used for email routing.
   - **TXT Record**: Used for verification and email security (e.g., SPF, DKIM).

   Here are examples of how to add each:

   **Example 1: Map Your Domain to an EC2 Instance**
   If you want to point `example.com` to an EC2 instance's public IP, create an **A Record**:
   
   1. In the Route 53 hosted zone, click **Create record**.
   2. Choose **Simple routing** and click **Next**.
   3. Select **A – IPv4 address**.
   4. Enter the **name** of the record (leave it blank if it’s for the root domain `example.com`).
   5. In the **Value** section, enter the **public IP address** of your EC2 instance.
   6. Click **Create records**.

   **Example 2: Map a Subdomain to an EC2 Instance**
   If you want to point `www.example.com` to the same EC2 instance, create an **A Record** for `www`:
   
   1. In Route 53, click **Create record**.
   2. Enter `www` for the **Record name**.
   3. Choose **A – IPv4 address**.
   4. Enter the **public IP address** of the EC2 instance.
   5. Click **Create records**.

   **Example 3: Map a Subdomain to an S3 Bucket (Static Website Hosting)**
   If you want `www.example.com` to point to an S3 bucket, follow these steps:
   
   1. **Enable Static Website Hosting** in S3:
      - Create an S3 bucket with the name `www.example.com` (this needs to match your domain's subdomain).
      - Go to the **Properties** of the S3 bucket, enable **Static Website Hosting**, and configure the **Index Document** and **Error Document** if needed.
   
   2. In Route 53, create a **CNAME record** for `www` pointing to the S3 endpoint URL:
      1. Click **Create record**.
      2. Set **Record type** to **CNAME**.
      3. In the **Value**, enter the S3 website endpoint URL (e.g., `example.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com`).
      4. Click **Create records**.

#### 4. **Route Traffic to Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**
   If you’re using **Elastic Load Balancers (ELB)**, you can point your domain to the ELB:

   1. In the Route 53 hosted zone, click **Create record**.
   2. Choose **A – IPv4 address**.
   3. Choose **Alias** and select your **ELB** from the dropdown.
   4. Click **Create records**.

#### 5. **Test Your Domain**
   Once you’ve updated your DNS records, you can test your domain by opening a browser and entering your domain name (e.g., `http://example.com`). You should see your website or application that is hosted on the resource you configured.

#### 6. **Set Up Additional Records (Optional)**
   You can also add other types of DNS records, such as:

   - **MX records** for email routing (if you're using services like Amazon SES or a third-party mail provider).
   - **TXT records** for domain verification (e.g., for SSL certificates or services like Google Search Console).
   - **SRV records** for specific service configurations.

### Conclusion
To route your domain in AWS using Route 53:

1. **Create a hosted zone** in Route 53 for your domain.
2. **Update your domain registrar’s nameservers** to point to AWS Route 53.
3. **Add DNS records** in Route 53 to route your domain to various AWS resources (e.g., EC2, S3, Load Balancer).
4. **Test your domain** to ensure it’s routing properly.
