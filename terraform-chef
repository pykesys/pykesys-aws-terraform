Yes, Terraform can execute configuration management code like Chef when an EC2 instance is created. This can be achieved through **user data scripts** or **provisioners**. Here are the methods:

---

### **1. Using User Data (Preferred Method)**
The `user_data` argument in the `aws_instance` resource allows you to specify a script that will run when the EC2 instance is first launched. You can use this to bootstrap Chef or any other configuration management tool.

#### Example:
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.example.id

  user_data = <<-EOF
    #!/bin/bash
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -y chef
    chef-client -j /etc/chef/first-boot.json
  EOF

  tags = {
    Name = "example-instance"
  }
}
```

In this example:
- A script installs Chef and runs it with a predefined configuration.
- Replace the `apt-get` commands with the equivalent for your OS if you're not using a Debian-based distribution.

---

### **2. Using Provisioners**
Terraform has a `provisioner` block that can execute remote scripts or commands after the instance is created. You can use `remote-exec` or `file` provisioners to handle Chef installation and setup.

#### Example with `remote-exec`:
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.example.id

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo apt-get update",
      "sudo apt-get install -y chef",
      "sudo chef-client -j /etc/chef/first-boot.json"
    ]

    connection {
      type     = "ssh"
      user     = "ubuntu"
      private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
      host     = self.public_ip
    }
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "example-instance"
  }
}
```

In this example:
- Terraform uses SSH to connect to the instance after it's created and runs the provided commands.
- Replace the `apt-get` commands with the equivalent for your OS.

---

### **3. Using Chef-Specific Provisioners**
Terraform supports specific Chef provisioners through plugins, but they are less commonly used now due to preference for lightweight and native methods like user data or `remote-exec`.

#### Example with `chef` Provisioner:
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  provisioner "chef" {
    node_name      = "example-node"
    server_url     = "https://chef-server.example.com/organizations/org"
    validation_client_name = "org-validator"
    validation_key = file("validator.pem")
    run_list       = ["recipe[nginx]"]
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "example-instance"
  }
}
```

- This requires the Chef provisioner plugin for Terraform, which may require additional setup.

### **Comparison of Methods**
| Method              | Advantages                                                                 | Disadvantages                                                              |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **User Data**        | Simple, native, and widely supported by AWS.                              | Limited to the first boot; debugging can be harder.                       |
| **Provisioners**     | More flexibility and control after the instance is created.               | Increases dependency on Terraform; can fail if SSH connections are flaky. |
| **Chef Provisioner** | Deep integration with Chef for advanced configurations.                   | Requires additional plugins and setup.                                   |

---

### Recommendations
- Use **user data scripts** for simple bootstrapping tasks.
- Use **provisioners** if you need advanced logic or dynamic operations post-launch.
- For long-term scalability, consider combining Terraform with a dedicated configuration management tool like Chef, Ansible, or Puppet.
